Expert Octo Palm Tree: Game Platform and Cross-Play Lookup Website - Specification
1. Introduction

This document outlines the specifications for "Expert Octo Palm Tree," a website that allows users to quickly and easily determine the platforms a video game is available on and its cross-play capabilities.  The target audience is gamers of all types who want to know if they can play with friends on different platforms or quickly check new game releases.

2. Functional Requirements

Game Search:
Users are presented with a text input field to enter the name of a game.
A "Search" button triggers the search process.
The search function uses the Brave Search API to find relevant information.
Gemini is used to formulate search queries for the Brave API and to extract relevant information from the search results.
Results Display:
The search results are displayed below the search bar.
The game title is displayed prominently.
A table shows platform availability (using checkmarks and crosses).
A dot-pointed paragraph details cross-play capabilities, including compatible platforms, limitations, restrictions, and steps to enable cross-play.
Mobile Responsiveness: The website is designed to be mobile-friendly, with vertical scrolling. Horizontal displays show the design centered with a background image on the sides.
3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Search results should be displayed quickly. Loading indicators should be used.
Usability: The website should be easy to use and navigate. The UI should be intuitive.
Accessibility: The website should be accessible to users with disabilities (WCAG compliance to be considered).
Security: Secure handling of API keys and user input.
Privacy: Use of the Brave Search API aligns with privacy considerations.
4. Technical Architecture

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. San Francisco font.
Back-end (if needed): Python/Flask or Node.js/Express (only if direct API interaction is required; can be client-side if Gemini and Brave API are accessed directly from the front-end).
API Integration: Gemini API for query formulation and information extraction. Brave Search API for searching.
Hosting: To be determined.
5. UI Design

Title: "Expert Octo Palm Tree," centered at the top. Dark gray text (#333333).
Search Bar: Centered below the title. Rounded corners. Placeholder text: "Name a game...". Light gray border (1px). White background.
Search Button: Pill-shaped, to the right of the text input. Light gray border (1px). Glassmorphism effect.
Background: Blurred image of Melbourne, Australia. Light gray overlay (#f8f8f8). Blur radius: 10-15 pixels. Background opacity: 70-80%.
Results Area: Below the search bar. Light gray border (1px).
Platform Table: Alternating row colors: white (#ffffff) and light gray (#f2f2f2). Checkmarks and crosses for platform availability.
Cross-play Statement: Dot points. Rounded corners for this section. Dark gray text (#333333).
Glassmorphism: Blurred background behind elements. Elements themselves have higher opacity (90-95%).
Color Scheme: Apple-inspired. Light backgrounds, dark gray text.
Font: San Francisco.
6. Data Handling

Input: Game title entered by the user.
Processing:
Game title sent to Gemini to formulate Brave Search API queries.
Brave Search API queries executed.
Relevant search results sent to Gemini for information extraction.
Extracted information (platforms, cross-play details) formatted as JSON.
Output: JSON data displayed on the website.
7. Error Handling

API Errors: Handle errors from Gemini and Brave Search APIs gracefully. Display user-friendly error messages.
No Results: Display a message if no results are found for a game title.
Gemini Extraction Failures: If Gemini fails to extract information, display a message indicating that the information is currently unavailable.
Input Validation: Sanitize user input to prevent issues.
8. Testing Plan

Unit Tests: Test individual components (e.g., search bar functionality, API interaction, data display).
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between components (e.g., search query generation, API calls, information extraction).
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Test the website with real users to ensure usability and functionality.
Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure compatibility across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Mobile Testing: Test on different mobile devices and screen sizes.
API Testing: Test the integration with Gemini and Brave Search APIs.
9. Implementation Details

API Keys: Securely store and manage API keys for Gemini and Brave Search.
Code Style: Consistent code style and formatting.
Documentation: Document the code thoroughly.
10. Future Considerations

Database Integration: Consider adding a database to store game information for faster lookups and more complex queries.
User Accounts: Potentially add user accounts to save favorite games or preferences.
Advanced Search Filters: Implement filters for platforms, genres, etc.
